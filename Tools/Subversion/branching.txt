Branches are for the minority.

only two branches:
Fixes Branch:
	while feature work continues on the trunk, a fixes branch is created to hold the fixes to the latest shipped version of the software.
	this allows you to fix problems without having to wait for the latest crop of features to be finished and stabilized.
Feature Branch:
	if a particular feature is disruptive enough or speculative enough that you don't want the entire development team
	to have to suffer through its early stages, you can create a branch on which to do the work.

Fixes branch
- used to apply bug fixes to a shipped version of the code
- only merge from the trunk to the branch (you simplify the process and reduce the possibility of conflicts if you keep all merging
	in one direction only)


Feature branches
- used by developers creating a major feature, or one which is speculative, and may not be included in the product.
- make the changes on the branch and check them in

Tags are typically used to create a static snapshot of the project at a particular stage
