most fundamental feature is port scanning

probe = an action taken or an object used for the purpose of learning something about the state of the network.
For example, an empty message can be sent simply to see whether the destination actually exists.
ping is a common utility for sending such a probe.


a probe would yield:
	full match
	soft match: recognizes service type, but no version info
	no match at all
