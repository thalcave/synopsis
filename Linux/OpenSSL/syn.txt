SSL = Secure Sockets Layer. 
- cryptographic protocols
- it is the standard behind secure communication on the Internet, integrating data cryptography into the protocol. 
-data is encrypted before it leaves the computer and decrypted only at destination

OpenSSL = API +command line tool

BIO = abstraction library that handles files and sockets, secure or not


SSLv2 = contained a number of security flaws which ultimately led to the design of SSL version 3.0
This later served as the basis for TLS (Transport Layer Security) version 1.0

SSLv23_method understands:
- sslv2
- sslv3
- tlsv1
- best choice when compatibility concern


Salted Hash
- 'Dictionary Attacks' are run against hashed passwords 
- Brute Force attack -  all entries in a dictionary were hashed using MD5 and those hash values then are compared against the password database
- the purpose of Salted Hash is to have this type of attack fail by attaching a random value - the so called salt - to each password 
and only then compute the hash over password and salt
- have to store three fields instead of user name and password: user name, salt and the salted hash of the password

******************************************************************************************
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is a security protocol that:
* Encrypts information sent over the network.
* Validates that a message sent to a recipient arrived without tampering.
* Authenticates the server identity to prevent server spoofing.
* With SSL 3.0, authenticates the client identity.

Certification Authority (CA) =  a person or a group of people who owns the CA certificate and creates and manages server and client certificates
-  issues trusted root certificates

A client and server, or even two servers, can communicate with one another only if the server or client
trying to make the connection has a trusted root certificate for the receiving server's certificate.

******************************************************
Replace certificates

1) identify Unitix clients (there are scripts on them which can be used to get new certs)
-for non-Unitix clients, which are under Puppet?

2) double set of certs


3) ctrl sends new certs to client
Done by CISCO:
1. autoenrollment with Key Rollover
- router automatically requests a certificate from the certification authority
- when the certificate xpires, a new certificate is requested.

2. Manual Certificate Enrollment with Key Rollover
