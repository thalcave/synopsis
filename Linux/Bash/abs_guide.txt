nullglob is a Bash shell option which modifies glob expansion such that patterns that match no files expand to zero arguments, rather than to themselves.
$ shopt -s nullglob
$ rm *ddadada
rm: missing operand
Try `rm --help' for more information.

$ shopt -u nullglob
$ rm *ddadada
rm: cannot remove `*ddadada': No such file or directory
