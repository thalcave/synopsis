gateway = alows 2 different networks to communicate with each other
* network node equipped for interfacing with another network that uses different communication protocols

router = connects two or more networks, forwarding packets; network layer
* reads the address information on the packet and determines the right destination, it then uses the information in its routing table or routing policy to direct the packet to the next network

bridge = connects network at link layer

TCP segment = unit of data sent by TCP to IP
IP datagram = unit of data sent by IP to network interface
frame = stream of bits that flow over Ethernet

multiplexing = process in which multiple signals are combined into one signal
demultiplexing = reverse process

iterative server = process requests one-by-one
concurrent server = for each request, spawn other server to process it

MTU - maximum transmission unit	


promiscuous mode = allows a network device to intercept and read each network packet that arrives in its entirety

RFC = Request for Comments : formalized memoranda addressing Internet standards

spoofing = attempt to gain access to a system by posing as an authorized user. Synonymous with impersonating, masquerading or mimicking.
IP (Internet Protocol) address spoofing = the creation of IP packets with a forged (spoofed) source IP address with the purpose of concealing 
						the identity of the sender or impersonating another computing system.
	forging the IP header to contain another IP source address


ARQ - Automatic Repeat-request
- error control method for data transmission which uses ACK's and timeouts
ACK = sent by receiver to indicate that it has correctly received data
timeout = reasonable point in time after the sender sends the frame/packet; if ACK is not received, re-transmit data

Stop-and-wait ARQ:
- simplest kind of automatic repeat-request (ARQ) method.
	- sends one frame at time
	- after sending each frame, the sender doesn't send any further frames until it receives an ACK (acknowledgement) signal. 


SAS = sorcerer's apprentice syndrom: (TFTP)
	a side timeouts --> duplicate packet is sent by the other side --> first side sends back 2 ACK etc.
resend: have a timer; if timer goes off and no ACK is received, resend data	
Solution: only the first ACK received would cause the next block of data to be sent :)
	
	
authoritative - identifiers are not assigned randomly, but are allocated by some organization

RX - received
TX - transmitted


root squashing = 
 Very often, it is not desirable that the root user on a client machine is also treated as root when accessing files on the NFS server. To this end,  uid  0
       is  normally  mapped  to a different id: the so-called anonymous or nobody uid. This mode of operation (called `root squashing') is the default, and can be
       turned off with no_root_squash
