Nagios® 
- a system and network monitoring application. 
- it watches hosts and services that you specify, alerting you when things go bad and when they get better.

Some of the many features of Nagios include: 
- monitoring of network services (SMTP, POP3, HTTP, NNTP, PING, etc.) 
- monitoring of host resources (processor load, disk usage, etc.) 
- simple plugin design that allows users to easily develop their own service checks 
- parallelized service checks 
- ability to define network host hierarchy using "parent" hosts, allowing detection of and distinction between hosts that are down and those that are unreachable 
- contact notifications when service or host problems occur and get resolved (via email, pager, or user-defined method) 
- ability to define event handlers to be run during service or host events for proactive problem resolution 
- automatic log file rotation 
- support for implementing redundant monitoring hosts 
- optional web interface for viewing current network status, notification and problem history, log file, etc.
