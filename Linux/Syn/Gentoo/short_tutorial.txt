***************************************************************
Maintaining Software

Portage = package management system
portage tree = collection of ebuilds, files that contain all information Portage needs to maintain software


Daily update:
emerge --sync = update portage tree
emerge -uavDN world = update all packages
etc-update = update conf files (from /etc)
http://en.gentoo-wiki.com/wiki/Upgrading_Packages


Checking for broken packages:
revdep-rebuild -i -p

***************************************************************
Working with packages

Check for package:
emerge --search <pname>
	OR
eix <pname> (much faster)

List all files from a package:
equery files <pname>

Find to which package a file belongs:
equery belongs <file>


USE flags
- a flag is a keyword that embodies support and dependency-information for a certain concept
If you define a certain USE-flag, Portage will know that you want support for the chosen keyword.

List USE flags for a package:
equery uses <package>
