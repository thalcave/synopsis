Portage = package management system. It provides compile-time option support (through USE flags)
portage tree = collection of ebuilds, files that contain all information Portage needs to maintain software

emerge --sync = update portage tree
world = clasa pachetelor globale instalate EXPLICIT

emerge --sync = updateaza portage
emerge -vpuD paket_name = pretend to install
emerge -uvD world = updateaza toate pachetele
emerge unmerge pachet = dezinstaleaza pachetele

/etc/make.conf - USE flags 

etc-update - Update config files, make sure you do not let etc-update
update config files you have edited


when unmerging, no dependencies are removed
revdep-rebuild - scans the entire system and looks for packages that require a rebuild.
emerge --deepclean = locates and removes unused reverse dependencies
	does not consider packages dynamically linked
	
	
If you want to update every single package on your system, add the --deep argument:

---------------------------------------------------------------

UDEV = generic kernel device manager.
It runs as a daemon on a Linux system and listens to events the kernel sends out if a new device is initialized or a device is removed from the system

Gentoo can work with devfs kernel support, udev userland support or static /dev. 
With the advent of the 2.6 kernel being stable on most archs, udev is recommended. 
udev is developed in three separate projects: namedev, libsysfs and, of course, udev

1)Namedev allows you to define the device naming separately from the udev program. 
2)libsysfs project provides a common API to access the information given by the sysfs filesystem in a generic way.
3)Every time the kernel notices an update in the device structure, it calls the /sbin/hotplug program. 
Hotplug runs the applications linked in the /etc/hotplug.d/default directory where you will also find a symlink to the udev application.
Hotplug directs the information given by the kernel to the udev application which performs the necessary actions on the /dev structure (creating or deleting device files).



emerge udev
You do not need to install hotplug unless you want your modules automatically loaded when you plug devices in

emerge --sync && emerge -uDN world will bring your entire system up to speed with the "latest Gentoo". 


USE flags
- a flag is a keyword that embodies support and dependency-information for a certain concept
If you define a certain USE-flag, Portage will know that you want support for the chosen keyword.

the kde keyword. 
	If you do not have this keyword in your USE variable, all packages that have optional KDE support will be compiled without KDE support. 
	All packages that have an optional KDE dependency will be installed without installing the KDE libraries (as dependency).
	If you have defined the kde keyword, then those packages will be compiled with KDE support, and the KDE libraries will be installed as dependency.


There are two types of USE-flags: global and local USE-flags.

    * A global USE-flag is used by several packages, system-wide. This is what most people see as USE-flags.
    * A local USE-flag is used by a single package to make package-specific decisions.




*****************************************************************************
locale = set of parameters that define's user language, country and variants that the users wants to see in their user interface.
	language identifier + region identifier

Specifying only needed locales
	locales are built by glibc
	
/etc/locale.gen
	specify which locales you want and run locale-gen

localepurge


*****************************************************************************
watchdog - tool that automatically reboot computer when something goes wrong( kernel goes crazy, processes that occupy 100% cpu etc)

	a device: /dev/watchdog
	computer writes to this device once a minute
	if it fails to do so, it is rebooted
