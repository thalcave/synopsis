"hardware acceleration"
	three-dimensional rendering uses the graphics processor on your video card instead of taking up valuable CPU resources drawing 3D image
	
"software acceleration" 
	CPU is forced to draw everything itself using the Mesa software rendering libraries, which takes up quite a bit of processing power

Xorg typically supports 2D hardware acceleration, it often lacks hardware 3D acceleration.


Direct Rendering Infrastructure - DRI, is a framework for allowing direct access to graphics hardware in a safe and efficient manner. It includes changes to the X server, to several client libraries and to the kernel. The first major use for the DRI is to create fast OpenGL implementations.
