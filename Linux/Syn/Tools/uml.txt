UML = fully-functional Linux kernel

User-Mode Linux gives you a virtual machine that may have more hardware 
and software virtual resources than your actual, physical computer.

Processes inside the user-mode kernel have no access 
to the hosting machine or to the outside world that's not explicitly provided.

UML hardware support comes in the form of virtual devices which use resources on the host.

The root_fs file needed for user-mode linux is a single file that contains an entire Linux filesystem.
