unit test framework = software tools to support running and writing unit tests

black box test - a test that runs a program and check if it was succesfully or not
white box test - when we can access internal code

failure = unit test reports that a test condition was evaluated to false
error = unexpected problem
application = software objects linked together; unit tests = use application's objects;
A unit test should test a particular behaviour within production code.
test coupling = a test depends on the result of other tests

XP = Extreme Programming
TDD = test driven development
	1.write a test and see it fail
	2.write the code so that test will succeed
	3.verify both the new code and the test
plain assert = most generic type of test assertion, which take a Boolean condition that must evaluate



Factory Method is a creational pattern. 
Model an interface for creating an object which at creation time can let its subclasses decide which class to instantiate
"Manufacturing" an Object.the use of factories gives the programmer the opportunity to abstract the specific attributes 
of an Object into specific subclasses which create them.
"Define an interface for creating an object, but let the subclasses decide which class to instantiate. The Factory method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses"
