identd = A user identification daemon for Linux, which implements the Identification Protocol (RFC1413). 
This protocol is used to identify active TCP connections. 
The daemon listens to TCP port 113 (auth) and can be run either as a stand-alone daemon or through inetd(8)



TCP Connection Hash Table Size is too big, and that is why /proc/net/tcp takes so long.

 hash tables are too big. Set a smaller one 
during this patch by using the new tcpehashorder= command line option.
It sets the hash table size as 2^order*4096 on i386. You can see the 
default order by looking at the dmesg of an machine booted without 
this option set.
You can find out how much it costs you by looking at 
/proc/net/sockstat. If the tcp_ehash_buckets value is the same as 
with the default hash tab size then it didn't cost you anything. 
If the value is very similar it's probably still ok; just if you 
get e.g. average bucket length >5-10 it's probably too small. 
The smaller the hash table the faster should identd work.

Is there something that changed from 2.2 -> 2.4 with regards to the
speed of netstat and /proc/net/tcp?A simple cat or wc -l on the file feels like about on the order of two
magnitudes slower ("time" reports around a second when the file has 450
entries).

***********************************************************************
A slpd regularly needs to check the LISTEN sockets on the local system to announce the 
services provided by them on the network. Problem is that reading
/proc/net/tcp can be extremly slow, because it requires to lock/unlock
hundred thousands of rwlocks. On some architectures (especially IA64 and
PPC64) read_unlock seems to be quite slow and a simple cat /proc/net/tcp
on a box with only a few sockets open can take over a second of systime.

OpenSLP Server (slpd) SLPv2 (RFC 2608) = IETF standard protocol that is used to discover/advertise 
services on the network. You can use SLP for anything from locating a suitable printer on your floor 
to discovering what LDAP directories are available in your organization.





S******************************************************************************
Hash table = a data structure that associates keys with values
- the primary operation it supports efficiently is a lookup: given a key , find the corresponding value
- it works by transforming the key using a hash function into a hash = a number that the hash table uses to locate the desired value.

TCP hash table =
	- Each entry in this table stores IP addresses and TCP ports characterizing a TCP connection.
	- the access to the hash table is carried out through a key, consisting of the source IP address and the source TCP port. 
	  The key is mapped by a hash function into the index of a list (better said, a bucket) of structures identifying transferred connections.

This patch makes the files /proc/net/tcp and /proc/net/tcp6 not acquire
the readlock for every bucket. 
On ppc64 and ia64 the readlocks are so expensive, that reading /proc/net/tcp
takes 0.25 seconds on a usual p670 LPAR.
And it locks 65536 buckets where just 20 chains are used at all in a normal
non-netserver setup.
Readlock only non-empty hash chains to avoid 65536 readlocks.
