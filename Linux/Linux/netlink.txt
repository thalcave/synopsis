ioctl  = part of the user-to-kernel interface of a conventional operating system. 
	Short for "Input/output control", ioctls are typically employed to allow userspace code to communicate with hardware devices or kernel components.
	
Netlink = socket-like mechanism for IPC between kernel and user space processes, as well as between user-space processes alone (like e.g., unix sockets) 
	or mixture of multiple user space and kernel space processes. However, unlike INET sockets, it can't traverse host boundaries, 
	as it addresses processes by their (inherently local) PIDs.
designed to be a more flexible successor to ioctl
