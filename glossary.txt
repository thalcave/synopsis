Distribute computing

distributed system = software system in which components located on networked computers communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages
- The components interact with each other in order to achieve a common goal. 
- There are many alternatives for the message passing mechanism, including RPC-like connectors and message queues.

significant characteristics of distributed systems:
	concurrency of components
	lack of a global clock
	independent failure of components
An important goal and challenge of distributed systems is location transparency.
Examples of distributed systems vary from SOA-based systems to massively multiplayer online games to peer-to-peer applications.

peer-to-peer (P2P) network = 

Distributed Systems
* Client-server (2-tier, 3-tier, n-tier exhibit this style)

* Shared nothing architecture: 
- each node is independent and self-sufficient
- no single point of contention
- Google: a SN system can scale almost infinitely by adding nodes in form of inexpensive computers

* Peer-to-peer:
- type of decentralized and distributed network architecture in which individual nodes in the network (called "peers") act as both suppliers and consumers of resources, in contrast to the centralized client–server model where client nodes request access to resources provided by central servers.

* Representational State Transfer (REST)

* Service-oriented (SOA)
- pieces of software providing application functionality as services to other applications. This is known as Service-orientation

Thundering herd problem 
* occurs when a large number of processes waiting for an event are awoken when that event occurs, but only one process is able to proceed at a time.


honeypot = honeypot is a computer system that is set up to act as a decoy to lure cyberattackers, and to detect, deflect or study 
attempts to gain unauthorized access to information systems. 
Generally, it consists of a computer, applications, and data that simulate the behavior of a real system that appears to be part of a 
network but is actually isolated and closely monitored. All communications with a honeypot are considered hostile, as there's no reason 
for legitimate users to access a honeypot. 
Viewing and logging this activity can provide an insight into the level and types of threat a network infrastructure faces while distracting 
attackers away from assets of real value.


"Simplicity is robust, complexity is fragile."

Cunningham's Law states "the best way to get the right answer on the internet is not to ask a question; it's to post the wrong answer."


Price segmentation = charging different prices to different people for the same or similar product or service. 
You see examples every time you go shopping: student prices at movie theaters, senior prices for coffee at McDonald's, 
people who use coupons and many more

Don’t Make Me Think = As a rule, people don’t like to puzzle over how to do things.


Good Work < Right Work < Great Work
Good work: 
* complex, quality could be improved
* takes great effort to author, debate, review, debug, and maintain.

Great work:
* solves difficult problems with a paucity of means
* deceptively simple

Right work:
* work that is undeniably, pound-on-the-table good, however unexciting or trivial: making public vars private, reducing the number of global vars etc.
* phronesis (practical wisdom)
