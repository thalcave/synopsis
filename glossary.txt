Distribute computing

distributed system = software system in which components located on networked computers communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages
- The components interact with each other in order to achieve a common goal. 
- There are many alternatives for the message passing mechanism, including RPC-like connectors and message queues.

significant characteristics of distributed systems:
	concurrency of components
	lack of a global clock
	independent failure of components
An important goal and challenge of distributed systems is location transparency.
Examples of distributed systems vary from SOA-based systems to massively multiplayer online games to peer-to-peer applications.

peer-to-peer (P2P) network = 

Distributed Systems
* Client-server (2-tier, 3-tier, n-tier exhibit this style)

* Shared nothing architecture: 
- each node is independent and self-sufficient
- no single point of contention
- Google: a SN system can scale almost infinitely by adding nodes in form of inexpensive computers

* Peer-to-peer:
- type of decentralized and distributed network architecture in which individual nodes in the network (called "peers") act as both suppliers and consumers of resources, in contrast to the centralized clientâ€“server model where client nodes request access to resources provided by central servers.

* Representational State Transfer (REST)

* Service-oriented (SOA)
- pieces of software providing application functionality as services to other applications. This is known as Service-orientation
