Functional Thinking - Neal Ford

Clojure: designed for concurrency (details are hidden from the developer)

List: composed of 'head' and 'tail'

Java.Stream(): 
* lazy
* order does not matter (filter and map vs. map and filter)


Filter: function that processes a list and returns a new list, containing elements for which the given predicate is true

Curry-ing: transforming a function which takes N arguments into N single-argument functions

Cede more mundane details such as iteration, concurrency, and state to the runtime as much as possible
