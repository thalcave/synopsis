The PushKit framework provides the classes for your iOS apps to receive pushes from remote servers.
Pushes can be of one of two types: standard and VoIP.

In the past, a VoIP app had to maintain a persistent network connection with a server to receive incoming calls and other data
This technique resulted in frequent device wakes that wasted energy.

Instead of persistent connections, developers should use the PushKit framework—APIs that allows an app to receive pushes (notifications when data is available) from a remote server.
Whenever a push is received, the app is called to action.

There are many advantages to using PushKit to receive VoIP pushes:
* The device is woken only when VoIP pushes occur, saving energy.
* Unlike standard push notifications, which the user must respond to before your app can perform an action, VoIP pushes go straight to your app for processing.
* VoIP pushes are considered high-priority notifications and are delivered without delay.
* VoIP pushes can include more data than what is provided with standard push notifications.
* Your app is automatically relaunched if it’s not running when a VoIP push is received.
* Your app is given runtime to process a push, even if your app is operating in the background.


Server will have to keep two certificates:
* one for signing "normal" notifications
* one for "VoIP" notifications.
