HBase is a "persistent, distributed, sorted, multidimensional map"
1. map

2. persistent

3. distributed
- built upon distributed FS:
        Hadoop's Distributed FS (HDFS) or Amazon's Simple Storage Service (S3)
        Google File System (GFS)
- replicated

4. sorted
- strict alphabetical order for keys -> items of greatest interest are next to each other

5. multidimensional
- map of maps


OLTP = On-Line Transaction Processing
- large number of short on-line transactions (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- very fast processing

OLAP = On-Line Analytical Processing
- low volume of transactions
- complex queries, requiring aggregations
