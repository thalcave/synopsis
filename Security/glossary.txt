forward-secure scheme = secret keys are updated at regular periods of time; 
* exposure of the secret key corresponding to a given time period does not enable an adversary to “break” the scheme (in the appropriate sense) for any prior time period.



MAC (message authentication code) = a short piece of information used to authenticate a message and to provide integrity and authenticity assurances on the message
* MAC algorithm:
    Input:  secret key
            message (to be authenticated)
    Output: MAC
    
HMAC (hash message authentication code) = MAC algorithm using a hash function
* calculating a message authentication code (MAC) involving a cryptographic hash function in combination with a secret cryptographic key
* can be used to verify data integrity and authentication
* any cryptographic function (MD5,SHA-1) can be used




SAS = short authentication string

MSISDN (misden) = number uniquely identifying a subscription in a GSM or a UMTS mobile network. 
* it is the telephone number to the SIM card in a mobile/cellular phone

IMEI = a number to identify mobile phones, 

IMEISV = IMEI software version

UUID (universally unique identifier) = an identifier standard used in software construction
* represented by 32 hexadecimal digits: 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000



replay attack = network attack in which a valid data transmission is maliciously or fraudulently repeated or delayed. 
    This is carried out either by the originator or by an adversary who intercepts the data and retransmits it, possibly as part of a masquerade attack by IP packet substitution
Example:
* Suppose Alice wants to prove her identity to Bob. 
  Bob requests her password as proof of identity, which Alice dutifully provides (possibly after some transformation like a hash function)
  meanwhile, Mallory is eavesdropping on the conversation and keeps the password (or the hash)
  After the interchange is over, Mallory (posing as Alice) connects to Bob
  when asked for a proof of identity, Mallory sends Alice's password (or hash) read from the last session, which Bob accepts
 
nonce = arbitrary number used only once in a cryptographic communication
* random number to ensure that old communications cannot be reused in replay attacks

ciphertext (or cyphertext) = the result of encryption performed on plaintext using an algorithm, called a cipher

Block cipher = deterministic algorithm operating on fixed-length groups of bits (called blocks) with an unvarying transformation that is specified by a symmetric key
- a cryptographic key and algorithm are applied to a block of data (for example, 64 contiguous bits) at once as a group rather than to one bit at a time
- so that identical blocks of text do not get encrypted the same way in a message (which might make it easier to decipher the ciphertext), 
it is common to apply the ciphertext from the previous encrypted block to the next block in a sequence
- so that identical messages encrypted on the same day do not produce identical ciphertext, an initialization vector derived from a random number generator is combined with the text in the first block and the key
Algo:
* break the plaintext into equally-sized blocks (e.g 64 bits)
* each block is transformed into another equally sized block
* apply chaining:
    XOR the ciphertext of the previous block with the plaintext of the next block, before the normal encryption technique is executed on the plaintext

Keystream: stream of random characters that are combined with a plaintext message to obtain ciphertext
- common operations: addition, subtraction, XORing

Stream cipher = symmetric key cipher where plaintext digits are combined with a pseudorandom cipher digit stream (keystream)
- a method of encrypting text (to produce ciphertext) in which a cryptographic key and algorithm are applied to each binary digit in a data stream, one bit at a time


Mode of operation = an algorithm that uses a block cipher to provide an information service such as confidentiality or authenticity
*  describes how to repeatedly apply a cipher's single-block operation to securely transform amounts of data larger than a block

counter (CTR) mode = turns a block cipher into a stream cipher

SQLCipher = open source library that provides transparent, secure 256-bit AES encryption of SQLite database files
- iOS, Android, Windows, Linux etc.




rainbow tables = precomputed table for reversing cryptographic hash functions, usually for cracking password hashes
