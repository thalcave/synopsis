Numerics


numeric_limits template = set of constants and inline functions
each implementation of STL provides a specialization of numeric_limits for each fundamental type

macros - CHAR_BIT, INT_MAX

valarray -vector optimized for numeric computation
	vallaray& operator*=(const T& arg) 	//computes v[i]*=arg for each element
	T sum() const;				//sum of all elements
	

Complex arithmetic
- a complex template

accumulate() = accumulate results of operation on a sequence
inner_product() = accumulate results of operation on two sequences
partial_sum() = generate sequence by operation on a sequence
adjacent_difference() = generate sequence by operation on a sequence
