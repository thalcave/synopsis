1)Can't get address of protected function
class A
{
protected
	func();
}

class B : public A
{
	&func	...error
}


2) Virtual functions:
three types:
	virtual
	pure virtual
	pure virtual with a body
	
pure virtual function = virtual function that you want to force derived classes to override
- the pure specifier (the "= 0" bit) only says that this class cannot be instantiated
- a pure virtual function can have a body and Derived class is obliged to override it
- destructor can be pure virtual but must have a body
- a pure virtual destructor may not be overriden (compiler silently generates a default one)
