the default behavior of atomics provides both atomicity and ordering for loads and stores.

sequential consistency: 
* all loads and stores must be "as if" they happened in the order you wrote them within each thread
* operations among threads can be interleaved however the system likes.

C++0x has atomic variables which also enforce sequential consistency when used in the default mode.
