Priority inversion problem:
* high priority task is indirectly pre-empted by a medium priority task "inverting" the relative priorities of the two tasks

Low priority process - L
Medium priority process - M
High priority process - H
R - resurce shared by L and H

1. L acquires a resource R (needed by H)
2. L is preempted by M
3. M is preempted by H
4. H blocks getting the resource R
5. M executes and finishes (being executed with a lower priority)
