********************************************************
Pointer Container Library

containers for holding heap-allocated objects in exception-safe manner and minimal overhead

container of shared_ptrs is suboptimal when:
	stored objects are not shared
	overhead implied by pointer pointers is innapropriate
	
this library provides standard-like containers for storing heap-allocated objects	
	for each of the standard containers there is a pointer container equivalent

Advantages:
	exception-safe pointer storage and manipulation
	notational convenience
	can be used for types non-assignable and non-copy constructible
	no memory overhead
	usually faster
Disadvantages:
	less flexibile than containers of smart-pointers
	
	
-----------------------------------------------------------

	pointer container manages memory( no worry about memory deleting)
