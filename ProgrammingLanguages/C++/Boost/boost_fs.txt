 Boost Filesystem Library provides portable facilities to query and manipulate paths, files, and directories.
 
 
 ---------------------------------------------
 Path
 	- an path object can be conceptualized as containing a sequence of strings
use
	string() when a generic string representation is required 
	native_directory_string(), native_file_string() : formatted for the particular operating system is required	 	

canonical form = All operations modifying path objects leave the path object in canonical form.
Normalized form = Normalized form is the same as canonical form, except that adjacent name, parent-directory elements are recursively removed.

Member fct:


initial_path() = stores the path returned by current_path()
root_name = returns first token of path
root_directory = separator
root_path = returns root_name() root_directory()
leaf() = returns last token of path


 ---------------------------------------------
 Operations
 
 Class directory_iterator
 	provides a C++ standard conforming input iterator which accesses the contents of a directory.
	dereferencing a directory_iterator yields a path to a file or sub-directory
	


is_empty(path)
is_directory(path)
exists(path)
