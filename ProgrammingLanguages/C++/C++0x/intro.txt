previous standard : C++98 or C++03
C++0x = expected in 2010

it's difficult to eliminate deprecated features, because of the users


Aim of C++0x : make it better!
design aims
- maintain stability and compatibility: don't break old code
- prefer generality to specialization: focus on classes, templates
- increase type safety: new facilities like initializer-lists, uniform initialization, template aliases, rvalue references, defaulted and deleted functions, and variadic templates.
- Improve performance and ability to work directly with hardware: C++ even better for embedded systems programming and high-performance computation
