std::forward = forwards the argument to another function with the value category it had when passed to the calling function.
* forward the parameters passed to a function template to another function call inside it without losing their own qualifiers (const-ref, ref, value, rvalue, etc.).
a conditional cast to an rvalue

template <typename T>
T&& forward(T&& param)
{
    if (is_lvalue_reference<T>::value)  //if T indicates lvalue, do nothing
    {
        return param;
    }
    else                                //else cast to rvalue
    {
        return move(param)
    }
}


------------------------------------------
enable_if = template struct that has two type arguments: 
* the first one is a boolean condition
* the second one is the return type we want our function to return if the condition is true
The enable_if struct has a static const attribute called type that maps to the return type expressed as the second type argument passed to the struct.

So, if the condition is true, the compiler will enable the function declared using enable_if, otherwise the function will simply be ignored by the compiler.
template <typename T>
typename enable_if<!has_iterator<T>::value, void>::type show(const T& x)
{
    cout << x << endl;
}
 
template <typename T>
typename enable_if<has_iterator<T>::value, void>::type show(const T& x)
{
    for (auto& i : x)
        cout << i << endl;
}


------------------------------------------
future & async:

async call = a method invocation that will be executed in a separate thread (or core or processor); 
so, the caller of the method does not wait for the result of the execution and continue doing what is next

async() has 3 params:
* launch policy:
- launch::deferred = synchronous execution
- launch::async = async execution
* pointer to a function
* parameters to be passed to the function

return:
*  object of type future<T> (T = return type of function passed as parameter)
future<T>::get(*) = returns the result of executing the function asynchronously
- if the launch policy is deferred, it executes the function in the same thread
- otherwise, it returns the result of the asynchronuos execution (waiting until the method finishes the execution)


------------------------------------------
std::any_of

initialize static variables:

std::once_flag flag;
static a;

void create()
{
    a = createA()
}

A& get()
{
    std::call_once(flag, &create);

    return a;
}


------------------------------------------
move semantics

lvalue = an expression that identifies a non-temporary object or a non-member function.
    object that has a name
prvalue = ("pure" rvalue) is an expression that identifies a temporary object (or a subobject thereof) or is a value not associated with any object.
    temporay object
    
xvalue = an expression that identifies an "eXpiring" object, that is, the object that may be moved from.
    nameless temporary,
    named object in scope
rvalue = an expression that is either a prvalue or an xvalue.


The move constructor is called whenever an object is initialized from xvalue of the same type

string&& name = getName(); --> name can be modified


// str is empty after move
    v.push_back(std::move(str));
