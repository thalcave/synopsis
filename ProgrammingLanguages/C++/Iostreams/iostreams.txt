<< = inserter for streams
>> = extractor for streams

Stream = object that formats and holds bytes
	Input stream = istream
	Output stream = ostream

good(), eof(), bad(), fail()

File streams
	ifstream, ofstream
	assure() to check if it's ok
	rdbuf() = returns a pointer to the object's streambuf
		ifstream if("file1.txt");
		ofstream of("file2.txt");
		of << if.rdbuf();	

Seeking in iostreams
a)Streampos = absolute location in a file
	- first call a "tell" function(tellp or tellg) that returns a streampos
	- call seekp or seekg with streampos
b)Use overloaded versions of seekp and seekg
ios::beg, ios::cur, ios::end
in.seekg(0, cur::end) = end of file
in.seekg(0, cur::begin) = begin of file


Stringstreams have replaced strstreams
Strstream = works directly with memory


Formatting
Class ios contains members to store all formatting data
