exception safety = reasonable behaviour when an exception is thrown during its execution


The basic guarantee: 
	that the invariants of the component are preserved, and no resources are leaked.
The strong guarantee: 
	that the operation has either completed successfully or thrown an exception, leaving the program state exactly as it was before the operation started.
The no-throw guarantee: 
	that the operation will not throw an exception.
