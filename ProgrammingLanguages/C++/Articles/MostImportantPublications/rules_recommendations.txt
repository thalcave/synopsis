4. Source code in files
- An include file should not contain more than one class definition.
- Place machine-dependent code in a special file so that it may be easily located when porting code from one machine to another.

A member function that does not affect the state of an object (its instance variables) is to be declared const.

A variable with a large scope should have a long name.
Encapsulate global variables and constants, enumerated types, and typedefs in a class.

Avoid the use of global objects in constructors and destructors.
