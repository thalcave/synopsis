Window types:
* Toplevel = A regular window, such as a dialog
* Popup	= A special window such as a tooltip. 

Container:
* Every widget in the Gtk library needs to be within some type of container. 
* The containers control the layout of the widgets on the parent window. In fact, a window itself is a type of container.

some widgets have default sizes. Menu Bars are supposed to be confined to the top of the window, so that's what they do
