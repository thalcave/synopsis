********************************************
Chapter 5. Using strings
- begins at 1, not 0

string. lower
	upper
	reverse
- take an arg by value, return and does not modify arg
string. rep("a", 5) - repeats string N times
	sub(string, start, end)
	len
tostring
string.format

	
-1 = last char in the string (end)
-2 = second-to-last...and so on

Pattern-matching
- gsub = global substitution

bracket class: [ /,.- ] = matches a char if it's a " " "/" "," "." or "-"
^ (caret) = will match only at the beginning
	find(string, "^abc") --> only if string begins with "abc"
$ = will match only at the end
	find(string, "abc$") --> only if string ends with "abc"

p[aeiou]t = pat or pet or...
p[a-d]t = pat or pdt or..
[a-emnv-z] - matches letters a through e, mn, v through z
[^aeiou] - match any char that ISN'T a vowel

string.gsub(Str, "%s+", " ")
- turns all whitespaces into a single space
%s - mathches a whitespace char

+ - as many as possible
