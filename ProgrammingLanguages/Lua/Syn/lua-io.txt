io.read - reads a line by default
 - "print" for quick-and-dirty programs, or for debugging, 
 - "write" when you need full control over your output:

filehandle = io.open(filename, mode)
	mode = r, w, a
		+,b
filehandle:write
	   close
	   read

read
"*1" - reads one line
"*a" - reads and returns whole file (minus anything that's already read)
"*n" - reads and returns a number
number - reads "number" chars

io.stdin, io.stdout, io.stderr

io.lines - opens a file and returns an iterator that loops through all lines
