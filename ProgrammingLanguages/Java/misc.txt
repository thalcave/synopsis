1. Weak vs. soft references
* weak reference = a reference that isn't strong enough to force an object to remain in memory
* soft reference = exactly like a weak reference, except that it is less eager to throw away the object to which it refers: if
there is enough memory, the object is retained longer


2. static initializers
Static initialization block is executed when the class is initialized, 
which happens before the first occurrence of any one of the following:
* T is a class and an instance of T is created.
* T is a class and a static method declared by T is invoked.
* A static field declared by T is assigned.
* A static field declared by T is used and the field is not a constant variable (


3. Enums with values:
public enum QnCounters
{
    NO_MEDIA_MESSAGES_SENT("noMediaMessagesSent"),
    NO_MEDIA_MESSAGES_RECEIVED("noMediaMessagesReceived");

    private String counterName;

    QnCounters(String counterName)
    {
        this.counterName = counterName;
    }

    public String getCounterName()
    {
        return counterName;
    }
}

* an enum cannot extend anything else, because it already extends Enum
* MyEnum.values() returns an array of MyEnumâ€™s values.
* An enum specifies a list of constant values assigned to a type.
* Enums can contain constructors, methods, variables, and constant class bodies.
