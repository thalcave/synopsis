I/O Streams


Byte streams: FileInputStream, FileOutputStream
    All other stream types are built on byte streams.

Character stream: FileReader, FileWriter
    A program that uses character streams in place of byte streams automatically adapts to the local character set and is ready for internationalization


Buffered Streams:
Byte streams: BufferedInputStream, BufferedOutputStream
Char streams: BufferedReader, BufferedWriter


Stream objects that implement formatting are instances of either PrintWriter, a character stream class, or PrintStream, a byte stream class.

Standard Streams

Byte streams:
standard input = System.in
standard output = Systen.out
standard error = System.err

The console:
* useful for secure password entry
* input and output streams


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data streams:
binary I/O of primitive data type values (boolean, char, byte, short, int, long, float, and double) as well as String values.

Object streams:
* support I/O of objects
* Most, but not all, standard classes support serialization of their objects. Those that do implement the marker interface Serializable.
