key: in encryption specifies the particular transformation of plaintext into ciphertext, 
     in decryption: vice versa


Symmetric-key encryption
* same key is provided to encrypt/decrypt messages
* 2 computers communicating must have the same key
DES, AES
the encryption key has to be delivered to the recipient

Asymmetric-key encryption:
* two different keys at once:
    private: only known on your computer
    public: 
sender:
* encrypts message with a random symmetric key
* the random symmetric key is encrypted using public asymmetric key

receiver:
* decrypt the random symmetric key using its own private asymmetric key
* it uses the decrypted random symmetric key to decode the message


Hashing Algorithm

* input: x
* hash algorithm: input * 143
* hash value: x * 143


Encryption methods:
1. Confusion:
e.g transpose a letter to another one

2. Diffusion:
column transposition

3. Key secrecy
