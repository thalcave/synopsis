Intuitive but incorrect asumption: 
	Intelligence is defined by behavior: we are intelligent because the way we are doing things
	Input --> BlackBox --> Output

Intelligence is defined by prediction
	we experience the world through a sequence of patterns
				we store them
				we recall them
				we match them up against reality, making predictions



Sophisticated senses --> Non-mammalian brain (sensory brain)--> Complex behavior

mammals have developed neocortex: 
* new layer on top of old brain (which is responsible for emotions) 
* memory system
