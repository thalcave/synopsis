halting problem = "Given a description of an arbitrary computer program, decide whether the program finishes running or continues to run forever"
Alan Turing proved in 1936 that a general algorithm to solve the halting problem for all possible program-input pairs cannot exist

Turing test = is a test of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behaviour equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human

The Turing machine = theoretical computing machine invented by Alan Turing
* a simple form of computer, composed by a tape, a ribbon of paper, has a head that can read the symbols, write a new symbol in place, and then move left or right.
* the Turing machine is said to be in a certain state, and then a program is a list of transitions, having a current state and a symbol under the head, 
what should be written on the tape, what would be the next state, and where the head should move



Chine Room:
* Suppose that I'm locked in a room and ... that I know no Chinese, either written or spoken
* He further supposes that he has a set of rules in English that "enable me to correlate one set of formal symbols with another set of formal symbols," that is, the Chinese characters. 
These rules allow him to respond, in written Chinese, to questions, also written in Chinese, in such a way that the posers of the questions - who do understand Chinese - 
are convinced that Searle can actually understand the Chinese conversation too, even though he cannot.
*  Similarly, he argues that if there is a computer program that allows a computer to carry on an intelligent conversation in written Chinese, the computer executing the program would not understand the conversation either.
