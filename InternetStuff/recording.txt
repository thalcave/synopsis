1. phonograph (by Edison) and later gramaphon
a diaphragm directly controlled a needle, and the needle scratched an analog signal onto a tinfoil cylinder:

Recording:
* You spoke into Edison's device while rotating the cylinder, and the needle "recorded" what you said onto the tin
* That is, as the diaphragm vibrated, so did the needle, and those vibrations impressed themselves onto the tin. 

Playback:
* the needle moved over the groove scratched during recording
* the vibrations pressed into the tin caused the needle to vibrate, causing the diaphragm to vibrate and play the sound.

analog wave = vibrations created by your voice

Analog wave is scratched by the needle onto the tin

every playback deteriorates the groove




2. Digital data

digital recording converts the analog wave into a stream of numbers and records the numbers instead of the wave.
the conversion is done by a device called an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) (playback by DAC)
The analog wave produced by the DAC is amplified and fed to the speakers to produce the sound.

The analog wave produced by the DAC will be the same every time, as long as the numbers are not corrupted


When you sample the wave with an analog-to-digital converter, you have control over two variables:
* The sampling rate - Controls how many samples are taken per second
* The sampling precision - Controls how many different gradations (quantization levels) are possible when taking the sample

3. CD
- stores digital data (numbers)
A CD has a single spiral track of data, circling from the inside of the disc to the outside. 
the data is stored as bumps on the CD


CD player:
* A drive motor spins the disc
* A laser and a lens system focus in on and read the bumps.
* A tracking mechanism moves the laser assembly so that the laser's beam can follow the spiral track

The fundamental job of the CD player is to focus the laser on the track of bumps. 
The laser beam passes through the polycarbonate layer, reflects off the aluminum layer and hits an opto-electronic device that detects changes in light. 
The bumps reflect light differently than the "lands" (the rest of the aluminum layer), and the opto-electronic sensor detects that change in reflectivity. 
The electronics in the drive interpret the changes in reflectivity in order to read the bits that make up the bytes.

audio CD bit rate = 1.411 kbit/s
sample rate = 44 kHz

4. MP3
- compression system for music

* There are certain sounds that the human ear cannot hear.
* There are certain sounds that the human ear hears much better than others.
* If there are two sounds playing simultaneously, we hear the louder one but cannot hear the softer one.
these sounds are removed in MP3

for a 320 Kbps, it's impossible for human ear to detect the difference between CD and MP3 file


5. Tapes

The basic idea involves an electromagnet that applies a magnetic flux to the oxide on the tape. 
The oxide permanently "remembers" the flux it sees. 

A tape recorder's record head is a very small, circular electromagnet with a small gap in it
