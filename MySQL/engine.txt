MySQL supports several storage engines

ISAM
	 MyISAM and HEAP storage engines were introduced. 
	 
	 MyISAM is an improved replacement for ISAM. 
	 HEAP storage engine provides in-memory tables 
	 MERGE storage engine allows a collection of identical MyISAM tables to be handled as a single table
	 Handle non-transactional tables


InnoDB and BDB storage engines
	handle transaction-safe tables
	included in MySQL-Max
	

NDB Cluster 
	storage engine used by MySQL Cluster to implement tables that are partitioned over many computers.




MyISAM
  .frm file  = stores the table definition. 
  .MYD (MYData) = the data file  
  .MYI (MYIndex) = the index file.

InnoDB 
   provides MySQL with a transaction-safe (ACID compliant) storage engine with commit, rollback, and crash recovery capabilities.
   .frm
    InnoDB stores its tables and indexes in a tablespace, which may consist of several files
