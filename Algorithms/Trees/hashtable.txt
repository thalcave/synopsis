Differences hash table/map:
1. map is sorted:
- suitable to find min, max an a certain element
2. keys in hash table are hashed via a hash function
- because a hash function creates collisions, a hash table must deal with them
3. Map is implemented as a red-black tree (because rebalancing operation is fast), hash table as an array
- access in map is O(log n), in hash is O(1)
- for small number of records, map is fast enough

Hash function example:
djb2(str):
	hash
	for each ch in str:
		hash = hash * 33 + ch;

Collision:
1. Chaining
Key --> List
Key --> Tree

2. Coalescence:
* find the first free slot to insert Key,Value
