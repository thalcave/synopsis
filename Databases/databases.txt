ACID
Atomicity: transaction executed full or not at all: ""all or nothing"
Consistency: after a transaction is executed, state of DB is consistent
Isolation: parallel operations have the same result as sequential
Durability: once a transaction is committed, it will remain so (even if power loss, crash, error etc.)


transaction:
* Begin the transaction
* Execute a set of data manipulations and/or queries
* If no errors occur then commit the transaction and end it
* If errors occur then rollback the transaction and end it


CRUD:
Create (INSERT)
Read   (SELECT)
Update (UPDATE)
Delete (DELETE)


CAP
Consistency = all clients have the same view of data
Availability = each client can always read and write
Partition tolerance = the system continues to operate despite arbitrary message loss or failure of part of the system

CAP Theorem = a distributed system cannot satisfy all three of these guarantees at the same time

Relational databases
MySQL, MS SQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQLite

relational database = database that has a collection of tables of data items, all of which is formally described and organized according to the relational model
relational model = each table schema must identify a column (the primary key), to uniquely identify each row. 
	a relationship can then be established between each row in the table and a row in another table by creating a foreign key = a column in one table that points to the primary key of another table. 

primary key = key (single or multiple attributes) which uniquely specifies a record inside a table
	cannot be null
	each table can have at most a primary key
	
unique key
	allows null values
	a table can have multiple unique keys
	
foreign key = a field in a table that matches the primary key of another table
	
index = a way to provide quicker access to data at the cost of additional writes and the usage of more disk space
	another data structure is created and sorted:
		binary search is possible
		smaller (contains only indexed data) --> less time in reading blocks from disk
	implemented via B-tree, bitmaps
	not considered part of the database

NoSQL database = non-relational database with data model:

1. Document
- data is encapsulated in standard format (JSON, XML etc)
CouchDB, MongoDB, Redis, 
Column
Document
Key-Value
Graph

2. Graph
- a graph with nodes, edges and properties is used to represent and store data
Neo4j

3. Key-value
- allow the application to store its data in a schema-less way. The data could be stored in a datatype of a programming language or an object
Cassandra,
