Replication capabilities allows the databases on one MySQL server to be duplicated on another

One-way replication :  One server acts as the master, while one or more other servers act as slaves
Master Server - write updated to its binary logs
	      - logs are sent to Slave Servers
	      - when the SS connects to MS, catches up any update


Benefits:
- robustness (slave serves as a backup)
- better response times for clients (splitting the load between masters and slaves - non-updating queries)
- backups can be made using a slave, without disturbing slaves	      

Each Slave Server receives from the Master the saved updates that the Master has recorded in its binary log, 
so that the Slave can execute the same updates on its copy of the data.
Master has to enable binary logging.

1)The slave creates an I/O thread, which connects to the master and asks it to send the statements recorded in its binary logs.

2)The master creates a thread to send the binary log contents to the slave (BinLog Dump)
  The slave I/O thread reads what the master Binlog Dump thread sends and copies this data to local files, known as relay logs, in the slave's data directory

3)The third thread is the SQL thread, which the slave creates in order to read the relay logs and to execute the updates they contain.
 A relay log is automatically deleted by the SQL thread as soon as it has executed all its events and no longer needs it
