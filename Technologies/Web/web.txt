Two commonly used methods for a request-response between a client and server are: GET and POST.
GET - Requests data from a specified resource
POST - Submits data to be processed to a specified resource
PUT - Requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the supplied URI.
DELETE - Deletes the specified resource.


---------------------------------------------------

REST =  Representational State Transfer.
-simple HTTP is used to make calls between machines.
- no cookies
- in a stateless system like REST, you should always verify the validity of your input,

REST API
It uses the four HTTP methods GET, POST, PUT and DELETE to execute different operation
CRUD - Create (Post), Read (Get), Update (Put), Delete (Delete)


Formats: XML, CSV, JSON

---------------------------------------------------

Safe operation  = is an operation that does not have any effect on the original value of the resource.
    (like dividing with 1)
Idempotent operation = is an operation that gives the same result no matter how many times you perform it


* never use GET to create or delete a resource on the server


difference between POST and PUT?
POST - Submits data to be processed to a specified resource
PUT - Requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the supplied URI.

PUT is idempotent, POST is not; Making a POST multiple times may result in multiple resources getting created on the server.
with PUT, you must always specify the complete URI of the resource --> the client should be able to construct the URI of a resource which does not exist on server side
e.g. creating a user

There is no difference between PUT and POST if the resource already exists, both update the existing resource.


difference between RESTful web services and SOAP web services?
- REST is more simple and easy to use than SOAP
- REST uses HTTP protocol for producing or consuming web services while SOAP uses XML.
- REST is lightweight as compared to SOAP and preferred choice in mobile devices and PDA's.
- REST supports different format like text, JSON and XML while SOAP only support XML.
- REST web services call can be cached to improve performance.
